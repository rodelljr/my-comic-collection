# My Comic Collection Demo
This Android Application demonstrates basic Jetpack Room features. This project goes over the basic components of Room:
- Entities
- Data Access Objec (DAO)
- Database Class

This application ties these basic components with an application that allows you to store basic comic information.
It is based on two Google Code Labs:
- [Persist Data with Room ](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-persisting-data-room?hl=en)
- [Read and Update Data with Room](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-update-data-room?hl=en)
